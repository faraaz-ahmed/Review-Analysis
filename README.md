# Review-Analysis

hello mahesh, take your time and understand the code i have implemented our algorithm for sentiment analysis same as in our ppt.
maybe we can find better approaches from net as my accuracy for this is very less (0.5000075).
i didnt find any need to preprocess since our data was clean, (without unnecessary spelling mistakes, emojis, or irregular characters)

im reading input from text file
im noting [word, P(positivity), P(negativity)] in "dictionary_contents.txt" file, so please take a look at it
right now i have ran the code for test data and accuracy was only 0.5,
